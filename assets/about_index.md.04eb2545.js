A tension from the stacks of unanswered emails from my freelancing client that I haven&#39;t had the time to answer. Feeling guilty for taking time off when I needed it.</p><p>I have no idea how long I can last, but at least I now have better balance. The goal is to earn enough money to support working for myself.</p><h3 id="trying-to-build-profitable-saas-projects-with-laravel-vue"><a class="header-anchor" href="#trying-to-build-profitable-saas-projects-with-laravel-vue" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 🔨 Trying to build profitable SaaS projects with Laravel &amp; Vue</h3><p>The primary way I want to support myself is through building profitable SaaS projects.
